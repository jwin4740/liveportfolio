                <p>My name is James Winkle. I graduated in 2010 from the University of Illinois with a B.S. degree in Biology. Upon graduation, I started working in the biomedical research lab at the University of Chicago where I coauthored an article<a class="bluelink" href="http://kaylab.uchicago.edu/manuscripts/Opal_MolecularPsychiatry.pdf" target="_blank"> (5-HT2C paper) </a> that was published in Molecular Psychology in October, 2013.</p>
                <p>I moved to North Carolina in 2012 and worked in the Genetics lab at Davidson College. After doing medical research for a few years, it became clear to me that I wanted to pursue a more rewarding career where I could apply my analytical skills in a variety of new ways.</p>
                <p>After looking at several career options I took the Harvard <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/" target="_blank" class="bluelink"> CS50 </a>(Computer Science) course through edX and fell in love with it. It was exciting to gain an understanding of the power of the computer and the endless possibilities for creative expression. I then decided to go back to school to get the skills needed to pursue a career in web development, which led me to the UNC Charlotte coding boot camp program.</p>
                <p>I am excited to finish the program and start a career where I can use my newfound skills to be part of a web development team at a growing company.</p>
